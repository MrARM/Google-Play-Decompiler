# Google-Play-Decompiler
Download and decompile APK files from google play.
## Thesis
The sole purpose is to make it easier to learn how an app works or find methods to use in xposed, etc.
Simply run node gpd.js com.example.package and the script will download, extract and decompile the APK.

## Future ideas
* Make web GUI
* Make search instead of providing package name(Ex. gpd.js Facebook)
